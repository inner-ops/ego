# Ego


- **[Destroy](./Destroy.md)**

  - The ego gives us identity, story, and the capacity to love in relationship... it's not the enemy, but a necessary interface for human experience. The common call to "destroy the ego" often stems from a misunderstanding that confuses transcendence with erasure. True awakening integrates the ego, allowing it to serve love without needing to control it.
